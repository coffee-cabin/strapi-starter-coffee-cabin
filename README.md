# strapi-template-to-customize

This repo is to be used as boilerplate code for creating and customizing a [strapi starter](https://strapi.io/blog/announcing-the-strapi-starter-cli) for your dev team.  

(Please see benefits of strapi starters in [this video series](https://strapi.training/videos/intro-to-auxiliary-benefits-to-strapi-starters), which goes over auxiliary benefits like: R&D, prototyping, and proofs of concept.)

# Customization Instructions

For instructions on how to use this repo, please refer to this video (link to TBA), which contains instructions on how to create & customize your dev team's very own strapi starter!  ðŸ™Œ

The video contains easy-to-access chapters and makes use of [kinesthetic learning style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesthetic_learning) by providing pause screens for hands-on exercises that keep up with the video content. 

# Customizable `starter` Folder
The video (link to TBA) contains thorough instructions on how to use this repo, but this is a quick side note that the `starter` folder contains a very basic, NodeJs/ExpressJs project that serves as a placeholder, frontend, web app for this customizable strapi starter.  

Please note that you can, however, replace the project in the `starter` folder for your dev team; and **this is encouraged**.  This way, you can use whatever frontend, web app tech you are leveraging--e.g. [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), etc.  

That said, there is nothing to say that you can't also use it as a starting point for you dev team's needs. This is completely up to you! ðŸ˜‰

# Misc Notes
The code in the `starter` folder was modified, but initially generated with [Express Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator).
